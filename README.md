## Choose For Me
Are you indecisive on something? Add in some options and Choose For Me will randomly choose something for you! Check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://choose-for-me-svelte.netlify.app/">DEMO</a> on Netlify!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install Dependencies
$ npm install

# Start Application in Development
$ npm run dev
```

## Lessons Learned:
Better knowledge of Svelte/SvelteKit and Tailwind/DaisyUI.

## Optimizations:
I would like to incorporate Mongo Atlas and an authenticator (or use Supabase) to allow users to save their options and choices.
